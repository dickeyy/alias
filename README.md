## What is it?
This is a website version of a game my family plays. We used to have to play on paper, however, we usually only play it on vacation. As you can imagine, finding large pieces of paper in hotels or air bnbs is hard. So I decided to modernize it. 

## How do I play?
The game itself is simple, here are the steps for the website version:
1. Have a group of at least 4 people. The more you have the better!
2. On the website, click "Create Game".
3. Put the host device somewhere everyone can see (works best if your screencast to a TV). The host can sign in with Google and remotely control the game!
4. In this version, you don't have to specify an MC, so everyone can play!
5. Players can then either scan the QR code on the host device or go to the website and enter the code displayed.
6. Now, every player must think of an "Alias". The Alias needs to be either the name of a famous person or someone every player knows. So for example I could either pick "Joe Biden" or the name of another player. The alias can also be a fictional character.
7. Once you have your alias, enter it on either your device or someone else's (devices are not linked to aliases so if you don't have a phone, don't worry you can use someone else's)
8. When everyone has entered their alias, the host will click "Start Game" 
9. You will then be displayed with a page where you can see a display of every alias. Anyone who has joined the game will be able to see it on their device or you can look at the host device.
10. Now choose who will go first (for the first round it doesn't matter who). 
11. The first player will then read all the aliases and guess the true identity of one alias. Say "Kyle, are you John Stamos?"
12. If the player guesses it correctly, the host will click on the alias that was guessed and it will cross out on all devices. The player that they guessed is now out and can't be guessed again. Then, the players turn continues until they make a wrong guess. 
13. If you guess wrong, whoever the original player tried to guess will now repeat step 11. 
14. This cycle continues until one alias is remaining, the true identity of that alias is the winner! 
15. If the host accidentally clicks on the wrong alias, don't worry, they can click it again and it will come back.

## Example
```
Player 1's alias = Harry Potter
Player 1's real name = Kyle

Player 2's alias = George Washington
Player 2's real name = Jimmy

Player 3's alias = Spongebob
Player 3's real name = Isaiah
-------
START GAME:
Kyle: "Hmmm... Isaiah, are you George Washington?"
Isaiah: "Nope, but Jimmy is Harry Potter."
Jimmy: "Wrong, let me think... Kyle, are you Harry Potter?"
Kyle: "Yea I am" 
* Kyle is out *
Jimmy: "Haha, Isaiah you are Spongebob!"
Isaiah: "Sigh yes."
* Isaiah is out *
Jimmy: "Yes!!"
* Jimmy wins! *
```
